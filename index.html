            <p>Dedication, determination and confidence make me perfect candidate for FIT. I am dedicated to my work, to
                my dream. I always wanted to be an artist but never got the chance to follow my dream. Specially for
                being a Muslim girl from a south Asian country named Bangladesh, where most of the time it is tough to
                follow heart. But when I came here in 2016, I got to know about FIT has a lot of programs based on art
                and photography and started researching how can I get into here. I was mesmerized when I saw the
                programs and the student work of FIT. I have decided that I need to apply FIT and for that I had to
                complete AAS degree. So I found out that LAGCC has AAS on Photography which I thought would be easier to
                transfer to FIT where I never practiced photography in my life.</p>
