            <h3>Professional Photographer and Amateur Developer</h3>
            <p>Dedication, determination and confidence make me perfect candidate for FIT. I am dedicated to my work, to
                my dream. I always wanted to be an artist but never got the chance to follow my dream. Specially for
                being a Muslim girl from a south Asian country named Bangladesh, where most of the time it is tough to
                follow heart. But when I came here in 2016, I got to know about FIT has a lot of programs based on art
                and photography and started researching how can I get into here. I was mesmerized when I saw the
                programs and the student work of FIT. I have decided that I need to apply FIT and for that I had to
                complete AAS degree. So I found out that LAGCC has AAS on Photography which I thought would be easier to
                transfer to FIT where I never practiced photography in my life.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Working in dark room or learning about large format camera or documenting for any project, or working in
                studio, everything what I did was so remarkable and momentous to me and created lots of significant
                spaces of every part of my life and my vision. I was determined to complete this degree with very
                valuable work. In the beginning, I used to get very frustrated for every critique I was having in my
                classes, but I never stopped. I was determined that I need to shoot and make enduring photos.
